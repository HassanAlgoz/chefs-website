## JSON
We need to make HTTP 'requests' to the backend API. All HTTP requests are followed by a 'response' from the server. We expect data formatted as JSON from the API when we use GET requests. There is a sample code in /js/index.js using the '$' object provided by the jQuery library.
- To retrieve data, use the GET request, and modify the HTML.
- To submit forms, use the POST request.
- To submit forms, but signify editing existing information, use PUT request.
- To submit a request of deletion, use the DELETE request.
